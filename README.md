# API Projects - CS101
Two Projects made as part of my CS101 course. <br>
Both of these projects are console based and have no GUI attached to them

### Project 1 - On This Day
This project asks user for a day of the year, and then gives them a random 'On This Day' fact

### Project 2 - Higher or Lower
Spinoff of the popular higher or lower game (https://www.higherlowergame.com/) using wikidata queries instead of using Google Trends data
